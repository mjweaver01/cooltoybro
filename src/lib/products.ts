      description: `I\'ve used many laptops, all the *nix-es, brands, etc. and this specific macbook is the best of them all. It plays minecraft; it\'s retina; it\'s portable, but with an almost 15in screen. I made this website with one.
      <br><br>
      I've researched a lot of versions, and this is the best bang-for-your-buck in terms of ram, processor, and storage.
      <br><br>
      If you need a good laptop, this is the one bro.

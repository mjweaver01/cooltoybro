    description: `<p class="product-description_content"><strong>WELCOME TO THE ERA OF AIRLESS</strong><br><br>After the 2023 unveiling of the Wilson Airless Prototype, the next step was clear: make it possible for the world to experience the future of sport for themselves. Enter Wilson Airless Gen1, an updated iteration of the original innovative concept.<br><br>Rather than being inflated, Airless Gen1 relies on a 3D-printed polymer lattice structure. The basketball nearly fits the performance specifications of a regulation basketball, including its weight, size and rebound (bounce). The form of the ball features 8 panel-like lobes and a familiar seam structure, with hexagonal holes across the surface allowing air to pass through freely. Each Airless Gen1 comes with a case, stand, and 3-letter customizable tag.</p><br/>`,

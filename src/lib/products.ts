      "<!-- show up to 2 reviews by default --><p> <span>The inspiring sound of a Stratocaster is one of the foundations of Fender. Featuring this classic sound - bell-like high end, punchy mids and robust low end, combined with crystal-clear articulation - the Player Stratocaster is packed with authentic Fender feel and style. It's ready to serve your musical vision, it's versatile enough to handle any style of music and it's the perfect platform for creating your own sound. Respecting our heritage while maintaining our innovative spirit, the power trio of Player Series single-coil pickups are crisp and articulate - it's authentic Fender tone with a modern edge. The \"Modern C\"-shaped maple neck's comfortable contours and smooth finish are ideal for almost any playing style. By adding a 22nd medium jumbo fret to the contemporary 9.5\"-radius fingerboard we've made it easier to express yourself musically. The updated 2-point tremolo design has smoother travel for enhanced playing feel while simultaneously giving you rock-solid tuning stability since there's less friction against the posts. Other features include master volume and tone controls, a 5-way pickup switch, 3-ply pickguard, synthetic bone nut, dual-wing string tree, sealed tuning machines and four-bolt \"F\"-stamped neck plate that marks this instrument as the real deal - as Fender as it gets.

The core book was first printed in 1970 as From Bindu to Ojas and its current title comes from a statement his guide, Bhagavan Das, made during Ram Dass's journeys in India. ",

He held appointments in four departments at Harvard University. He published books, drove a Mercedes and regularly vacationed in the Caribbean. By most societal standards, he had achieved great success. . . . And yet he couldn‚Äôt escape the feeling that something was missing.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Psilocybin and LSD changed that. During a period of experimentation, Alpert peeled away each layer of his identity, disassociating from himself as a professor, a social cosmopolite, and lastly, as a physical being. Fear turned into exaltation upon the realization that at his truest, he was just his inner-self: a luminous being that he could trust indefinitely and love infinitely.<br><br>And thus, a spiritual journey commenced. Alpert headed to India where his guru renamed him Baba Ram Dass‚Äî‚Äúservant of God.‚Äù He was introduced to mindful breathing exercises, hatha yoga, and Eastern philosophy. If he found himself reminiscing or planning, he was reminded to&nbsp;‚ÄúBe Here Now.‚Äù&nbsp;He started upon the path of enlightenment, and has been journeying along it ever since.<br><br></span><span class="a-text-italic">Be Here Now</span><span>&nbsp;is a vehicle for sharing the true message, and a guide to self-determination.</span>  </div>',

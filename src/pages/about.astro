          Like most bros, we struggled finding <strong>high quality, affordable products.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          Lost in a daze of mass-produced garbage and overpriced caske re-defining opulence, we knew
          there had to be a better way.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          Have you ever just wanted to find the best overall product in a genre, without wading
          through over-opinionated troll-spew?

        <p class="mt-4">Do you struggle finding good gifts for your significant (br)other?</p>

          For some links, we will recieve a small reward, should you decide to purchase a product.
          For others, we simply track whether or not you showed interest from us; nothing more. If
          you do decide to click one of the buy buttons on this site, seriously, bless up üôèüôå
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          I'm just a bro trying to break out of the matrix, and every one of your clicks gets me
          closer to that goal.

          In reward, we offer you this DJ Khaled random quote generator, which is actively
